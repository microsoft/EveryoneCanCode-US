# Sprint 8: Deploy to the Cloud
⏲️ _Est. time to complete: 60 min._ ⏲️

This sprint is designed to help students deploy the To-Do application to the cloud.  The sprint will walk students through deploying the To-Do application to the Microsoft Azure cloud.

**📕Feature: Deploy to Azure**
1. [**📖 Deploy To-Do App to Azure**](/Track_1_ToDo_App/Sprint-08%20-%20Deploy%20to%20the%20Cloud/Feature%201%20-%20Deploy%20to%20Azure.md/User%20Story%201%20-%20Deploy%20to%20Azure.md)

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that once **your to-do application** is deployed to the cloud it **is running on the public internet and is accessible by anyone that has the URL to view and/or edit  information.  So, please do not put personal items in your to-do list**.   We would also **highly recommend that you setup security on the website** if you plan to continue to run it and use the to-do list functionality. You enable this through the next user story.

2. [**📖 Setup Authentication**](/Track_1_ToDo_App//Sprint-08%20-%20Deploy%20to%20the%20Cloud/Feature%201%20-%20Deploy%20to%20Azure.md/User%20Story%202%20-%20Setup%20Authentication.md)

<br/>


3. **BONUS Activity**:  If you have time, you can experiment with setting up different authentication providers for the website.  At the time of this repo being created there are providers for Facebook, Google, Twitter, GitHub, Apple, and OpenID Connect.
