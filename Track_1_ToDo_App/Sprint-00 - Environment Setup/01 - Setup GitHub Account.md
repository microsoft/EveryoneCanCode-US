<summary>What is GitHub?</summary>

GitHub is actually two things: **Git** and **Hub**.

**Git** is a version control software. It allows developers to work on a specific project at the same time by tracking the changes. If something goes wrong, you can easily undo the changes with Git.
**Hub** is nothing special in itself, but it represents the "social network" of developers built on top of Git. While GitHub does not own the Git software, it has created a platform that makes it easy to access and collaborate with Git. The groundbreaking feature of GitHub is that it makes it super easy to share/show your code with the world or just store it. You no longer have to worry about where you store your code. Companies have GitHub accounts for the same reason. GitHub provides an easy way to store your code online with built-in version control.

## Bonus Challenge: Build your own Octocat

Octocat is the official mascot of GitHub and the cutest, friendliest, and most tentacular cat you'll ever meet! With its unique octopus-like shape, Octocat has become a beloved symbol of the GitHub community, popping up in merchandise, events, and social media.

As an extra challenge for those who finish early, we dare you to unleash your creativity and design your own Octocat using the Octocat builder at [https://myoctocat.com](https://myoctocat.com/). This tool allows you to customize the color, shape, and accessories of your Octocat, and share it with others.


Think of your Octocat as your personal avatar, your spirit animal, or your alter ego. Give it a funky hairstyle, a cool outfit, or a quirky accessory. Make it reflect your personality, your interests, or your sense of humor.

Who knows, your Octocat might become the next internet sensation, the star of a blockbuster movie, or the mascot of a future GitHub feature. Or it might just make you smile :)

So go ahead, have fun, and show us what you've got!
